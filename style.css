										/*hex values in css*/

/*We usually use decimals, or base 10 numbers, which use the symbols 0 to 9 for each digit. Hexadecimals (or hex) are 
base 16 numbers. This means it uses sixteen distinct symbols. Like decimals, the symbols 0-9 represent the values zero 
to nine. Then A,B,C,D,E,F represent the values ten to fifteen. Altogether, 0 to F can represent a digit in hexadecimal, 
giving us 16 total possible values. You can fiThe RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.
The RGB value for white looks like this:

rgb(255, 255, 255)

Instead of using six hexadecimal digits like you do with hex code, with RGB you specify the brightness of each color with a number between 0 and 255.

If you do the math, the two digits for one color equal 16 times 16, which gives us 256 total values. So RGB, which starts counting from zero, has the exact same number of possible values as hex code.

In CSS, we can use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. 
For example, #000000 is black and is also the lowest possible value. 

/*The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color.*/

/*The digit F is the highest number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness.*/

/*For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened form gives one digit for red, one digit for 
green, and one digit for blue.*/
